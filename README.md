# how to use this image

this image is intended to be used in combination with an external/linked
unbound instance. as such, it is not operational on its own.

the *examples/* directory contains a suggested deployment setup
using docker-compose.

## using a customized image

```dockerfile
FROM unbound-zone-feeder:latest
COPY hosts.blacklist /data/
CMD [ "-f", "/data/hosts.blacklist" ]
```

the image takes no build arguments and can be built running
`docker build -t my-unbound-zone-feeder .`

if the customized image does **not** spawn an unbound server,
you must link it to the container or make it otherwise accessible.

`docker run -d --name my-running-unbound-zone-feeder
  --add-host=unbound:10.180.0.1
  --env UZF_HOST=unbound
  my-unbound-zone-feeder`

you may need to publish the ports the prometheus webserver is
listening on to the host by specifying the -p option, for example
*-p 80:8080* to publish port 80 from the container host to port
8080 in the container. make sure the port you're using is free.

## using commandline arguments

`docker run -d --name my-running-unbound-zone-feeder
  --link some-unbound:unbound
  unbound-zone-feeder:latest
  --host unbound`

## using environment variables

* *UZF_VERBOSE*

  if defined, increases verbosity (equivalent to `--verbose`)

* *UZF_INSTANT*

  if defined, runs a job immediately in addition to the schedule (equivalent to `--instant`)

* *UZF_METRICS*

## with custom instructions via commandline

`docker run -d --name my-running-unbound-zone-feeder
  --link some-unbound:unbound
  unbound-zone-feeder:latest
  --host unbound`

to get more information about the supported commandlines,
run the image with the *-h* option

`docker run --rm -it unbound-zone-feeder:latest -h`

## directly via bind mount

`docker run -d --name my-running-unbound-zone-feeder
  -v /path/to/hosts:/data:ro
  unbound-zone-feeder:latest
  --blacklist-file /data/hosts.blacklist`

note that your host's `/path/to/hosts` folder should be populated with a file
named `hosts.blacklist`. the content of it is formatted with one blacklisted
host per line.

# input processing

hosts can be read from various sources using different
retrieval strategies.

## commandline

input provided via the commandline interface is forwarded
without modifications and **not** filtered.

## file

files are read line by line ignoring empty ones and those
starting with *#*. no filtering is applied.

## url

remote files are parsed for values following the *hosts file*
syntax. processing involves:

* accepting lines starting with *127.0.0.1*
* accepting lines starting with *0.0.0.0*
* stripping port numbers from hostnames
* removing trailing comments
* lowercase conversion

```
# ignored
127.0.0.1 localhost
# valid entries
127.0.0.1 localhost.test
0.0.0.0 all.interfaces.test
127.127.127.127 again.localhost.test # comment
127.0.0.1 port.localhost.test:8080
127.0.0.1	tab.localhost.test
127.0.0.1 utf-8.localhost.test # ðŸ˜„ unicode character
::1 ipv6.localhost.test #[IPv6]
```
